Live page (WIP): [Pokedex](https://fshenton.github.io/pokedex/)

I have been set a challenge by the beautiful and illustrious [Pookage](https://github.com/pookage), the brief of which is as follows:

> A desktop-first web-app that provides information about a number of gen-1 pok√©mon; functioning
both as a quick-reference guide, but with more detailed information accessible if the user
requires it.  
  

There will be four core development phases:
1. Pre-production
2. MVP
3. Usability, Accessibility and Polish
4. Fully Responsive

In addition, there will be an additional *Stretch Goal* phase should the core phases be completed quickly enough.  
  

Hopefully I don't end up sharing a striking resemblence with this guy....
